Base and Derived Classes:

- OOP allows you to define classes from existing classes, this is called INHERITANCE
- Inheritance allows you to define a general class (i.e. a base class) and later extend it to more specialized classes (i.e derived classes)
- EX: a base class Geometric and derived classes Triangle and Circle
- Private data fields in the base class cannot be accessed by the derived classes, so you need to include public accessor/mutator functions if defined
- Polymorphism is the idea that a derived class can behave like itself and the base class at the same time
- Overloading a function has the same name but different parameters
- Redefining a function has the same name and same parameters but different code in the function (used for classes)
- Abstract classes


Syntax:
class DERIVED: public BASE
so...
class Circle: public GeometricObject
